"""
Before Nightly Processing
==========
- Get players and matches data from challonge -> "tournaments" collection
- Get user records for tournaments they entered and the tags they have
   participated as-> store in "users" collection

Fix Challonge Matches
==========
- For every match in every tourney, first we will replace all winner and loser id's
   with the tag that the player entered as.
- For each tag that the user has participated in a specific tourney as, we will
   apply the user's facebook_id to the winner/loser id for all matches from
   that tournament.

Apply TrueSkill Algorithm
=========
1) Sort all tournaments by date
2) Build map of {id: rating}. "id" is preferably facebook_id but can also be their
   tag that they have entered the tournament as.
3) Run TrueSkill on matches chronologically.

Upsert Data
=========
- Store all of a user's matches on their user record.
- Sort by rating to produce Rankings -> data/current_rankings.json
- Upsert ratings to user records & upsert ranking to user record.
